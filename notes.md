# Things to Implement:

- [ ] Create seperate HTML files with activity and discover/profile pages which can permanently be shown on the sides. These will have different values depending on whether user is logged in
- [ ] Current files are placeholders, the idea is to build the skeleton of the website which will eventually be filled with dynamic posts and user information
- [ ] Background Image is to only be featured on each user's profile. Find way to fill negative space on general website, or allow each user to have a custom background??
- [ ] Feature 4
- [ ] Feature 5


- [ ] Post page navigation for different uses 
- [ ] Search page navigation for different uses 
- [ ] Profile Page Query for requested User
